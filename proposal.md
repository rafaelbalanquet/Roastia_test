### Roastia

A list of team members on your project

### Background and Overview
    Craft coffee shops have experienced high growth over the recent decade,
    and as such, demand has increased for fair-trade, ethically-sourced,
    craft coffee across the country.

    Roastia allows indie coffee enthusiasts to find craft coffee shops
    closest to them and filter results by desired taste qualities. Shops
    can also be associated with the origin of the beans, fair-trade status
    and various other relevant attributes.
